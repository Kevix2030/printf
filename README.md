our first collabborative project in ALX.
Me and my partner (Paul abila) will be handling Printf project as a team.
First we start by creating a Printf repository on git hub, then clone it on the web terminal(sandbox)
we cd into the repo the configure it with github username and email. 
in the Printf repo i will create README file 
create main.h file to capture header files
